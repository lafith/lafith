### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lafith Mattara. Currently working as Project Engineer at [Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre](https://www.hticiitm.org/). I am working for the image processing team under their Endoscopy Development Group.

## Some of my works

### Simulator
* [AUV Simulator](https://github.com/lafith/AUV-Simulator-Unity) - A simulator for testing the software stack of an Autonomus Underwater Vehicle. Developed using Unity and Blender.
### Shader Programming
* [Fragment_Shaders_Image_Manipulation](https://github.com/lafith/Fragment_Shaders_Image_Manipulation) - Unity shader scripts written for creating image effects including kernel convolution.
### Paper Implementations
* [pymusica](https://github.com/lafith/pymusica) - Python Implementation of the classic paper 'MultiScale Image Contrast Amplification', with laplacian pyramid as the multi-resolution representation.
* [ppdenoise](https://github.com/lafith/Phase-Preserving-Image-Denoising) - Python implementation of Peter Kovesi's paper 'Phase Preserving Denoising of Images'.
### Utility
* [UE5Template](https://github.com/lafith/UE5Template) - A template for an UE5 C++ project combined with a bash scipt for editing, playing, building and shipping from any terminal and editor, without any need of Visual Studio.
